# Digital Image Processing Homework Repository

This repository contains my completed homework assignments for the digital image processing course. Each assignment is presented as a Jupyter Notebook with accompanying PDF exports. The code covers various image processing techniques and algorithms taught during the course.

## Notebooks

The `Notebooks` folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for each homework assignment. The code, comments, and explanations are written in a mix of English and Serbian. While the course was conducted in Serbian, the Markdown cells in the notebooks are primarily written in Serbian to facilitate understanding.

### Assignment 1
- [assignment1.ipynb](Notebooks/assignment1.ipynb)

### Assignment 2
- [assignment2.ipynb](Notebooks/assignment2.ipynb)

### Assignment 3
- [assignment3.ipynb](Notebooks/assignment3.ipynb)

## PDFs

The `PDFs` folder includes PDF exports of the Jupyter Notebooks. These PDFs provide a static snapshot of the final outputs and can be useful for offline viewing or printing.

### Assignment 1
- [assignment1.pdf](PDFs/assignment1.pdf)

### Assignment 2
- [assignment2.pdf](PDFs/assignment2.pdf)

### Assignment 3
- [assignment3.pdf](PDFs/assignment3.pdf)

## Language

The course was conducted in Serbian, and the Markdown cells in the Jupyter Notebooks are written in Serbian to align with the language of instruction. However, for clarity, method names, algorithms, and key concepts are provided in both English and Serbian.

Feel free to explore the assignments and provide feedback or suggestions. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue in the repository.
